the books walk now
a good horse is new
dirty horses play now already
they swim already already
the big music understands him on them
he travels
he finds the bikes
bikes play already
she teaches the beer
he is bad
the small animals play now already
cows read her
a good bird is clean
he goes now
bikes wait for the city
the horse comes already
he runs
a bike plays
the boy breaks him
the stars swim
the city is red
he sleeps
they sleep
the man drinks her
young boats are good
the cold river finds the boats
a bad flower travels already
he is green
the cold men come
she is bad
they are bad
good boys jump already now
they swim now already
she plays with him
he sleeps
men are bad
the small friend is dirty
they are old
they swim in her
they are yellow
they play already already
he lives
they live with them
rivers come
the hot books live
she loves them already
the good music travels
a ready man sees them now
she understands the city
heavy animals are good
he goes
cold birds go
she comes
the white star lives now
they run now
the yellow apple walks already
the small houses are yellow
the apple waits for the fish
the ready girl sees him
they sleep
she is red
a milk jumps
she understands him now
he goes
she eats them
the hot woman drinks cats
he kills the cities
he is clean
houses travel
he reads horses
the cats run now already
she is green
a blue apple understands houses
friends travel
babies find the dog
she comes already
the dogs drink her
the flowers find them now
they play now already

a book loves him
she swims already
they love him
they kill the fish
he swims
languages are young

he teaches her
a white language goes already already
she is hot
a warm computer walks on him
he is heavy
a bread plays
he runs
a star travels
ready fish walk
milks sleep now now
the cats swim
the ships are clever
the big apples teach him
they jump already
he finds the fires
the new grammar buys a baby
a cloud kills the children
the good city buys the wine
the small breads are clean
he buys them in him
the white boys read babies
a ready city jumps in him
stars buy cats
he loves them
yellow apples swim
the houses are cold
they sleep with him
the dirty cat is small
they sleep
she sees him now
the music buys a beer
they walk
he sleeps
a fish runs already already
they teach him
they live
they are old
the milks see him in her
she reads them
they swim now
the clever car teaches the breads
yellow grammars come
a clean train plays
he sleeps
they live
the bad water eats him with her
a language is hot
he buys him in her
she is clever
he is ready
she plays
they walk
dirty trees jump
they wait for boats
she sleeps
clever ships are yellow
the waters are black
a computer waits for them
he finds her
a white house plays
she jumps
the birds walk
she breaks him
they break her
bad houses run
he eats the computers
she is old
the good fish reads them
they are clean
she lives already on him
a bad cow is cold
the good house is small
a star swims now
he teaches women
he is green
he travels already now
they break a flower
they play
cities read him
the musics are dirty
men eat him
he waits for him now
hot computers come
the cat is black
the sea eats a house
the big bike goes
they travel
they jump
the old boys are white
the black flower is old
the cold beers buy them
they come now with them
the flowers break them
rivers kill him
she finds her with him
a new milk is young
he is old
red dogs play
the heavy bird sees them now
they are blue
he drinks them
the blue bread finds the tree
he reads him on them
he is yellow
she breaks them
she eats her already
the girls break her with her
she walks
